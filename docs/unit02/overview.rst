Unit 2: Version Control and Git
=======================================

Here we look at the concept of version control. This concept will be used 
throughout the course for assignements as well as projects 
to support collaboration and issue tracking for development of
a software application.

If you don't have one already, please create an account on
`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, and verify that `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
is installed on your system, and if not please install.
